This is the first website our team has made 🥲.
This is a photography portfolio website📸 .
we took a help from various sources like- our mentor Mr Shivansh Prasad Sir  , Github ![GithubCatGIF](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cf378d1-87e1-467b-82bc-945a510fcbaf)
, youtube etc.

We have used  free stock images from pexel❤️👌 .
During making this project we learnt a lot about how html, css and js combines to make websites looking responsive and attractive.
This is only a landing page site.
We haven't deployed our website yet.

We hope you all love PhotoLife ❤️😊
